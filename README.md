# David Thompson Transcription Pipeline

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project provides an OCR pipeline for transcribing David Thompson's handwritten manuscripts. It uses image preprocessing, line segmentation, and Kraken OCR to generate machine readable text.

## Features
- Image preprocessing with OpenCV
- Line segmentation using morphological operations
- OCR with Kraken and custom models
- Simple batch processing and training scripts

See `docs/usage.md` for basic usage instructions and `docs/training.md` for model training notes.

A comprehensive OCR pipeline for transcribing David Thompson's handwritten manuscripts.

## Project Overview

This project implements a four-stage pipeline for processing scanned images of handwritten text:
1. Image preprocessing and enhancement
2. Line segmentation
3. OCR using Kraken with custom-trained models
4. Output formatting and validation

See the `docs/` directory for detailed usage and training instructions.
